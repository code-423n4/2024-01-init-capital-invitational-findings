# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the INIT Capital smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit took place between January 26â€”February 2 2024.

## Wardens

In Code4rena's Invitational audits, the competition is limited to a small group of wardens; for this audit, 5 wardens contributed reports:

  1. [said](https://code4rena.com/@said)
  2. [ladboy233](https://code4rena.com/@ladboy233)
  3. [rvierdiiev](https://code4rena.com/@rvierdiiev)
  4. [sashik\_eth](https://code4rena.com/@sashik_eth)
  5. [0x73696d616f](https://code4rena.com/@0x73696d616f)

This audit was judged by [hansfriese](https://code4rena.com/@hansfriese).

Final report assembled by PaperParachute.

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 7 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 3 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 4 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 4 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 2 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 INIT Capital repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational), and is composed of 22 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 2334 lines of Solidity code.

In addition to the known issues identified by the project team, an [Automated Findings report](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md) was generated using the [4naly3er bot](https://github.com/Picodes/4naly3er) and all findings therein were classified as out of scope.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities based on three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

For more information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com), specifically our section on [Severity Categorization](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization).

# High Risk Findings (3)
## [[H-01]  MarginTradingHook#updateOrder lacks access control](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/34)
*Submitted by [sashik\_eth](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/34), also found by [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/29) and [said](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/24)*

The `MarginTradingHook#updateOrder` function allows users to update their orders, it checks that the requested order is active order (L513) and that the function caller has opened position (L515). However, this function fails to check that user `initPosId` is equal to the `initPosId` saved in the order struct, meaning that the caller is an order creator:

```solidity
File: MarginTradingHook.sol
503:     function updateOrder(
504:         uint _posId,
505:         uint _orderId,
506:         uint _triggerPrice_e36,
507:         address _tokenOut,
508:         uint _limitPrice_e36,
509:         uint _collAmt
510:     ) external { 
511:         _require(_collAmt != 0, Errors.ZERO_VALUE);
512:         Order storage order = __orders[_orderId];
513:         _require(order.status == OrderStatus.Active, Errors.INVALID_INPUT);
514:         uint initPosId = initPosIds[msg.sender][_posId];
515:         _require(initPosId != 0, Errors.POSITION_NOT_FOUND);
516:         MarginPos memory marginPos = __marginPositions[initPosId];
517:         uint collAmt = IPosManager(POS_MANAGER).getCollAmt(initPosId, marginPos.collPool);
518:         _require(_collAmt <= collAmt, Errors.INPUT_TOO_HIGH);
519: 
520:         order.triggerPrice_e36 = _triggerPrice_e36;
521:         order.limitPrice_e36 = _limitPrice_e36;
522:         order.collAmt = _collAmt;
523:         order.tokenOut = _tokenOut;
524:         emit UpdateOrder(initPosId, _orderId, _tokenOut, _triggerPrice_e36, _limitPrice_e36, _collAmt);
525:     }
```

### Impact

Any order in the `MarginTradingHook` contract could be updated by other users.

### Proof of Concept

The next test added to the `TestMarginTradingHelper` file could show a scenario when the user can update some other active orders:

```solidity
    function testUpdateNotOwnerOrder() public {
        _setUpDexLiquidity(QUOTE_TOKEN, BASE_TOKEN);
        address tokenIn = USDT;
        address collToken = WETH;
        address borrToken = USDT;
        {
            (uint posIdAlice, uint initPosIdAlice) = _openPos(tokenIn, collToken, borrToken, ALICE, 10_000, 10_000);

            (uint posIdBob, ) = _openPos(tokenIn, collToken, borrToken, BOB, 10_000, 10_000);

            uint markPrice_e36 = lens.getMarkPrice_e36(collToken, borrToken);
            uint triggerPrice_e36 = markPrice_e36 * 9 / 10; // 90% from mark price
            uint limitPrice_e36 = markPrice_e36 * 89 / 100; // 89% from mark price
            address tokenOut = WETH;
            MarginPos memory marginPos = hook.getMarginPos(initPosIdAlice);
            uint orderIdAlice = _addStopLossOrder(
                ALICE,
                posIdAlice,
                triggerPrice_e36,
                tokenOut,
                limitPrice_e36,
                positionManager.getCollAmt(initPosIdAlice, marginPos.collPool)
            );
            vm.startPrank(BOB, BOB);
            hook.updateOrder(posIdBob, orderIdAlice, triggerPrice_e36 - 1, tokenOut, limitPrice_e36, 1000);
            vm.stopPrank();
            Order memory order = hook.getOrder(orderIdAlice);
            require(order.triggerPrice_e36 == triggerPrice_e36 - 1, 'order not updated');
        }
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding a check that prevents the possibility of updating arbitrary orders, similar to the `cancelOrder` function:

```solidity
     _require(order.initPosId == initPosId, Errors.INVALID_INPUT);
```

## [[H-02] Order's creator can update `tokenOut` to arbitrary token](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/23)
*Submitted by [said](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/23), also found by [ladboy233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/6)*

When an order is created, it checks whether the `order.tokenOut` is equal to `marginPos.baseAsset` or `_tokenOut` is equal to `marginPos.quoteAsset`. However, when `tokenOut` is updated via `updateOrder`, it can be changed to an arbitrary token. This has the potential to be exploited by changing `tokenOut` to a high-value token right before the executor executes the `fillOrder`.

### Proof of Concept

It can be observed that order's creator can update `order.tokenOut` to arbitrary token.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/main/contracts/hook/MarginTradingHook.sol#L504-L526>

```solidity
    function updateOrder(
        uint _posId,
        uint _orderId,
        uint _triggerPrice_e36,
        address _tokenOut,
        uint _limitPrice_e36,
        uint _collAmt
    ) external {
        _require(_collAmt != 0, Errors.ZERO_VALUE);
        Order storage order = __orders[_orderId];
        _require(order.status == OrderStatus.Active, Errors.INVALID_INPUT);
        uint initPosId = initPosIds[msg.sender][_posId];
        _require(initPosId != 0, Errors.POSITION_NOT_FOUND);
        MarginPos memory marginPos = __marginPositions[initPosId];
        uint collAmt = IPosManager(POS_MANAGER).getCollAmt(initPosId, marginPos.collPool);
        _require(_collAmt <= collAmt, Errors.INPUT_TOO_HIGH);

        order.triggerPrice_e36 = _triggerPrice_e36;
        order.limitPrice_e36 = _limitPrice_e36;
        order.collAmt = _collAmt;
        order.tokenOut = _tokenOut;
        emit UpdateOrder(initPosId, _orderId, _tokenOut, _triggerPrice_e36, _limitPrice_e36, _collAmt);
    }
```

This can be exploited by the order's creator. When the executor is about to execute the `fillOrder`, the order creator can front-run the operation by changing the `order.tokenOut` to a token with a high value. Consequently, the executor will transfer the amount that needs to be transferred but using this new high-value token. But this require hook already have approval from the executor to manage the new high value token.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Validate the new token when `updateOrder` is called :

```diff
    function updateOrder(
        uint _posId,
        uint _orderId,
        uint _triggerPrice_e36,
        address _tokenOut,
        uint _limitPrice_e36,
        uint _collAmt
    ) external {
        _require(_collAmt != 0, Errors.ZERO_VALUE);
        Order storage order = __orders[_orderId];
        _require(order.status == OrderStatus.Active, Errors.INVALID_INPUT);
        uint initPosId = initPosIds[msg.sender][_posId];
        _require(initPosId != 0, Errors.POSITION_NOT_FOUND);
        MarginPos memory marginPos = __marginPositions[initPosId];
        uint collAmt = IPosManager(POS_MANAGER).getCollAmt(initPosId, marginPos.collPool);
        _require(_collAmt <= collAmt, Errors.INPUT_TOO_HIGH);
+       _require(_tokenOut == marginPos.baseAsset || _tokenOut == marginPos.quoteAsset, Errors.INVALID_INPUT);

        order.triggerPrice_e36 = _triggerPrice_e36;
        order.limitPrice_e36 = _limitPrice_e36;
        order.collAmt = _collAmt;
        order.tokenOut = _tokenOut;
        emit UpdateOrder(initPosId, _orderId, _tokenOut, _triggerPrice_e36, _limitPrice_e36, _collAmt);
    }
```

## [[H-03] `fillOrder` executor can be front-run by the order creator by changing order's `limitPrice_e36`, the executor's assets can be stolen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/22)
*Submitted by [said](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/22), also found by [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/28) and [ladboy233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/18)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/main/contracts/hook/MarginTradingHook.sol#L539-L563> 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/main/contracts/hook/MarginTradingHook.sol#L387>

`limitPrice_e36` acts as slippage protection for the order creator, depending on the trade/order position (whether long or short). A higher or lower limit price impacts the `tokenOut` amount that needs to be transferred to the order's creator. However, when the executor executes `fillOrder`, it can be front-run by the order creator to update `limitPrice_e36` and steal tokens from the executor.

### Proof of Concept

When `fillOrder` is executed, it will calculate the `amtOut` that needs to be transferred to `order.recipient` by calling `_calculateFillOrderInfo`.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/main/contracts/hook/MarginTradingHook.sol#L532-L564>

```solidity
    function _calculateFillOrderInfo(Order memory _order, MarginPos memory _marginPos, address _collToken)
        internal
        returns (uint amtOut, uint repayShares, uint repayAmt)
    {
        (repayShares, repayAmt) = _calculateRepaySize(_order, _marginPos);
        uint collTokenAmt = ILendingPool(_marginPos.collPool).toAmtCurrent(_order.collAmt);
        // NOTE: all roundings favor the order owner (amtOut)
        if (_collToken == _order.tokenOut) {
            if (_marginPos.isLongBaseAsset) {
                // long eth hold eth
                // (2 * 1500 - 1500) = 1500 / 1500 = 1 eth
                // ((c * limit - borrow) / limit
>>>             amtOut = collTokenAmt - repayAmt * ONE_E36 / _order.limitPrice_e36;
            } else {
                // short eth hold usdc
                // 2000 - 1 * 1500 = 500 usdc
                // (c - borrow * limit)
>>>             amtOut = collTokenAmt - (repayAmt * _order.limitPrice_e36 / ONE_E36);
            }
        } else {
            if (_marginPos.isLongBaseAsset) {
                // long eth hold usdc
                // (2 * 1500 - 1500) = 1500 usdc
                // ((c * limit - borrow)
>>>             amtOut = (collTokenAmt * _order.limitPrice_e36).ceilDiv(ONE_E36) - repayAmt;
            } else {
                // short eth hold eth
                // (3000 - 1 * 1500) / 1500 = 1 eth
                // (c - borrow * limit) / limit
>>>             amtOut = (collTokenAmt * ONE_E36).ceilDiv(_order.limitPrice_e36) - repayAmt;
            }
        }
    }
```

As can be observed, it heavily relies on `limitPrice_e36` to calculate `amtOut`. A malicious order creator can front-run the execution of `fillOrder` and steal assets from the executor by changing `limitPrice_e36`, resulting in a high value of `amtOut` depending on the order's position.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider to add `limitPrice_e36` check inside the `fillOrder` if it bigger than min/max provided limit price, revert the operation.

# Medium Risk Findings (4)
## [[M-01] MarginTradingHook users could potentially be DOSed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/35)
*Submitted by [sashik\_eth](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/35)*

The `refundNative` modifier unwraps and sends a native coin to the `msg.sender` at the end of the function execution. However, it could send native even if the case function call was not related to native coin trading - for example, if wrapped tokens were already on the `MarginTradingHook` balance. At the same time if the function caller is the contract that has no function except native transfer - the whole transaction would be reverted. Malicious actors could DOS such contracts by sending dust amounts of wrapped native tokens to the `MarginTradingHook` balance.

```solidity
File: MarginTradingHook.sol
72:     modifier refundNative() { 
73:         _;
74:         // refund native token
75:         uint wNativeBal = IERC20(WNATIVE).balanceOf(address(this));
76:         // NOTE: no need receive function since we will use TransparentUpgradeableProxyReceiveETH
77:         if (wNativeBal != 0) IWNative(WNATIVE).withdraw(wNativeBal);
78:         uint nativeBal = address(this).balance;
79:         if (nativeBal != 0) {
80:             (bool success,) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: nativeBal}('');
81:             _require(success, Errors.CALL_FAILED);
82:         }
83:     }
```

### Impact

Contracts that use `MarginTradingHook` could be DOSed in case they have no function to receive native.

### Proof of Concept

Consider the next scenario:

1.  Alice creates a contract that she would use as the caller of `MarginTradingHook`. Since Alice planning to work only with ERC20 tokens, she doesn't implement the `receive` or payable `fallback` function on her contract.
2.  Alice using a contract in combination with `MarginTradingHook` for her trading activity for some time.
3.  Bob sends to `MarginTradingHook` 1 wei of wrapped native token.
4.  Now each call from Alice's contract to `MarginTradingHook` functions that include the `refundNative` modifier would revert since `MarginTradingHook` unwraps 1 wei of `WNATIVE` and tries to send it to the Alice contract. Since the last one can't accept native transfers - calls revert.

Bob could effectively continue DOS even if native funds were withdrawn by other users, by spamming dust amount txs each block, at the same time Alice could lose funds on her active positions due to changing market conditions.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding the explicit parameter `refundNative` that users could set to true in case they expect a native transfer. Alternatively, remove the `require` statement at the end of the `refundNative` modifier code.

## [[M-02] `fillOrder` not properly cancel order when collateral of position is empty](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/20)
*Submitted by [said](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/20), also found by [sashik\_eth](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/41)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/main/contracts/hook/MarginTradingHook.sol#L380>

When `fillOrder` is triggered, and the order's collateral size inside the position manager is empty, it should change the order status to canceled. However, due to mistakenly updating memory data instead of the storage `__orders` data, it will not be canceled properly.

### Proof of Concept

It can be observed that when collateral size is empty, `fillOrder` will try to update `order` memory data `status` to `OrderStatus.Cancelled` and return the call.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/main/contracts/hook/MarginTradingHook.sol#L379-L383>

>>>     Order memory order = __orders[_orderId];
        _require(order.status == OrderStatus.Active, Errors.INVALID_INPUT);
        MarginPos memory marginPos = __marginPositions[order.initPosId];
        address collToken = ILendingPool(marginPos.collPool).underlyingToken();
        address borrToken = ILendingPool(marginPos.borrPool).underlyingToken();
        // if position is empty, cancel order
        if (IPosManager(POS_MANAGER).getCollAmt(order.initPosId, marginPos.collPool) == 0) {
>>>         order.status = OrderStatus.Cancelled;
            emit CancelOrder(order.initPosId, _orderId);
            return;
        }
        // validate trigger price condition
        _validateTriggerPrice(order, marginPos);
        // calculate fill order info
        (uint amtOut, uint repayShares, uint repayAmt) = _calculateFillOrderInfo(order, marginPos, collToken);
        // transfer in repay tokens
        IERC20(borrToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), repayAmt);
        // transfer order owner's desired tokens to the specified recipient
        IERC20(order.tokenOut).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, order.recipient, amtOut);
        // repay tokens
        _ensureApprove(borrToken, repayAmt);
        IInitCore(CORE).repay(marginPos.borrPool, repayShares, order.initPosId);
        // decollateralize coll pool tokens to executor
        IInitCore(CORE).decollateralize(order.initPosId, marginPos.collPool, order.collAmt, msg.sender);
        // update order status
        __orders[_orderId].status = OrderStatus.Filled;
        emit FillOrder(order.initPosId, _orderId, order.tokenOut, amtOut);
    }
```

However, this will not change the storage value of the `order` inside the `__orders` data. This will mislead users into assuming that the order is canceled when, in fact, it is not.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Update `__orders[_orderId].status` storage data instead :

```diff
    function fillOrder(uint _orderId) external {
        Order memory order = __orders[_orderId];
        _require(order.status == OrderStatus.Active, Errors.INVALID_INPUT);
        MarginPos memory marginPos = __marginPositions[order.initPosId];
        address collToken = ILendingPool(marginPos.collPool).underlyingToken();
        address borrToken = ILendingPool(marginPos.borrPool).underlyingToken();
        // if position is empty, cancel order
        if (IPosManager(POS_MANAGER).getCollAmt(order.initPosId, marginPos.collPool) == 0) {
-            order.status = OrderStatus.Cancelled;
+            __orders[_orderId].status = OrderStatus.Cancelled;
            emit CancelOrder(order.initPosId, _orderId);
            return;
        }
        // validate trigger price condition
        _validateTriggerPrice(order, marginPos);
        // calculate fill order info
        (uint amtOut, uint repayShares, uint repayAmt) = _calculateFillOrderInfo(order, marginPos, collToken);
        // transfer in repay tokens
        IERC20(borrToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), repayAmt);
        // transfer order owner's desired tokens to the specified recipient
        IERC20(order.tokenOut).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, order.recipient, amtOut);
        // repay tokens
        _ensureApprove(borrToken, repayAmt);
        IInitCore(CORE).repay(marginPos.borrPool, repayShares, order.initPosId);
        // decollateralize coll pool tokens to executor
        IInitCore(CORE).decollateralize(order.initPosId, marginPos.collPool, order.collAmt, msg.sender);
        // update order status
        __orders[_orderId].status = OrderStatus.Filled;
        emit FillOrder(order.initPosId, _orderId, order.tokenOut, amtOut);
    }
```

## [[M-03] SwapType.CloseExactOut balance check too strict can be DOSed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/16)
*Submitted by [ladboy233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/16), also found by [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/25) and [said](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/19)*

SwapType.CloseExactOut balance check too strict can be DOSed.

### Proof of Concept

In CoreCallback function, we have the logic below:

```solidity
uint amtOut = IERC20(swapInfo.tokenOut).balanceOf(address(this));
if (swapInfo.swapType == SwapType.OpenExactIn) {
	// transfer to coll pool to mint
	IERC20(swapInfo.tokenOut).safeTransfer(marginPos.collPool, amtOut);
	emit SwapToIncreasePos(swapInfo.initPosId, swapInfo.tokenIn, swapInfo.tokenOut, amtIn, amtOut);
} else {
	// transfer to borr pool to repay
	uint amtSwapped = amtIn;
	if (swapInfo.swapType == SwapType.CloseExactOut) {
		_require(IERC20(swapInfo.tokenOut).balanceOf(address(this)) == swapInfo.amtOut, Errors.SLIPPAGE_CONTROL);
		amtSwapped -= IERC20(swapInfo.tokenIn).balanceOf(address(this));
	}
	emit SwapToReducePos(swapInfo.initPosId, swapInfo.tokenIn, swapInfo.tokenOut, amtSwapped, amtOut);
}
```

Note the logic below:

```solidity
	if (swapInfo.swapType == SwapType.CloseExactOut) {
		_require(IERC20(swapInfo.tokenOut).balanceOf(address(this)) == swapInfo.amtOut, Errors.SLIPPAGE_CONTROL);
		amtSwapped -= IERC20(swapInfo.tokenIn).balanceOf(address(this));
	}
```

This check is too strict:

```solidity
_require(IERC20(swapInfo.tokenOut).balanceOf(address(this)) == swapInfo.amtOut, Errors.SLIPPAGE_CONTROL);
```

Malicious user can DOS the swap by simply perform a tiny swap by frontruning the swap to change the token ratio in the LP pool.

For example, the swapInfo.amtOut is 1000 USDC, and swapInfo.tokenOut is USDC.

It is difficult to get exactly 1000 USDC, so any swap that executes before the swap can make the received USDC amount to 1000.1 USDC or 999. USDC, then swap transaction reverts.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Do not use ==, use >=

## [[M-04] LP unwrap / wrap is fully broken if master chef contract has insufficient reward token and block decollateralize wlp and wlp liquidation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/2)
*Submitted by [ladboy233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/2), also found by [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/30)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/wrapper/WLpMoeMasterChef.sol#L145> 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/core/InitCore.sol#L284>

LP unwrap / wrap is fully broken if master chef contract has insufficient reward token.

### Proof of Concept

We need to take a look at the external master chef contract that is not in the control of the init capital protocol team.

When deposit / withdraw / harvest / claim, this function [\_modify](https://github.com/traderjoe-xyz/moe-core/blob/5eb20a10cbe4ee01f8db20da950309cb297e3c09/src/MasterChef.sol#L257) is called, which is [this code](https://github.com/traderjoe-xyz/moe-core/blob/5eb20a10cbe4ee01f8db20da950309cb297e3c09/src/MasterChef.sol#L466)

```solidity
	if (moeReward > 0) _moe.safeTransfer(account, moeReward);

	if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) {
		extraRewarder.onModify(account, pid, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply);
	}
```

As we can see, when deposit / withdraw / harvest, the pending reward is transferred from master chef contract to msg.sender (which is the lp wrapper contract).

When calling extraRewarder.onModify, the reward is transferred from extra rewarder to wrapper contract.

But someone needs to transfer the moe token into the master chef to ensure there is sufficient reward token balance.

Someone needs to transfer the reward token into extraReward contract to ensure there is sufficient reward token balance.

In case when there are insufficient reward token in master chef contract and extraReward, the code will revert:

```solidity
	if (moeReward > 0) _moe.safeTransfer(account, moeReward);

	if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) {
		extraRewarder.onModify(account, pid, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply);
	}
```

Suppose the reward accounting update is that the wlp contract is entitled to get 10000 moe token and 100 usdc token as extra reward, but in master chef there are only 9000 token, attempting to transfer the 10000 more tokens will revert.

The impact is severe because this revert would block [lp unwrap](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/wrapper/WLpMoeMasterChef.sol#L145) and block original lp owner attemps to [decollateralize wlp](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/core/InitCore.sol#L284) and make liquidation revert as well.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When regular withdraw failed, the code should call [emergencyWithdraw](https://github.com/traderjoe-xyz/moe-core/blob/5eb20a10cbe4ee01f8db20da950309cb297e3c09/src/MasterChef.sol#L287).

This function does not claim reward, but at least this function can ensure withdraw wlp when decollateralize lp or liquidation transaction does not revert.

## [01] Set treasury missing check `address(0)`

The code should validate _treasury address is not address(0) when setting Treasury in [lending pool](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/lending_pool/LendingPool.sol#L243).

```solidity
function setTreasury(address _treasury) external accrue onlyGovernor {
        treasury = _treasury;
        emit SetTreasury(_treasury);
    }
```

Tn fact by default the treasury address is not set, and accrue interest would revert when [minting interest to treasury address(0)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/lending_pool/LendingPool.sol#L160).

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/f6f59bf10f40e06111c66e2fadf652a47919d2f6/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20Upgradeable.sol#L251

```solidity
function _mint(address account, uint256 value) internal {
	if (account == address(0)) {
		revert ERC20InvalidReceiver(address(0));
	}
	_update(address(0), account, value);
}
```

The reward token is never removed, but the problem is that the master chef admin can [remove extra reward or update extra reward](https://github.com/traderjoe-xyz/moe-core/blob/5eb20a10cbe4ee01f8db20da950309cb297e3c09/src/MasterChef.sol#L417).

Suppose the reward token list has [MOE, and WETH], WETH is the extra reward, then the extra reward changes to [JOE], then WETH token data is considered outdated.

## [02] If the `order.recipient` is blocklisted, his order can never be fulfilled

When creating a order in margin trading hook, the code [record order.recipient](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/hook/MarginTradingHook.sol#L496)

Token support blocklisting behavior:

https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#tokens-with-blocklists

But when filling the order, if the order.recipient is blocklisted, the order can never be fulfilled and fill order always revert.

## [03] `fillOrder` may be subject to reentrancy

The function [fillOrder](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/hook/MarginTradingHook.sol#L372) set order status as filled after external token transfer.

https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc777

This opens room for reentrancy if the token is ERC777 token when external user can control the execution flow via the receive hook.

The external token transfer is this [line of code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/hook/MarginTradingHook.sol#L391):

```solidity
// transfer order owner's desired tokens to the specified recipient
       IERC20(order.tokenOut).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, order.recipient, amtOut);
```

Where order.recipient can re-enter the fillOrder to fill order more than one times it is recommended to add nonReentrant modifer to the function fillOrder.

## [04] Lack of view function for user to query if the `flashloan` can be used

It is recommended to implement and adopt [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3156] where there are views function for external user to call to query if the flashloan can be used:

```solidity
   function maxFlashLoan(
        address token
    ) external view returns (uint256);

    /**
     * @dev The fee to be charged for a given loan.
     * @param token The loan currency.
     * @param amount The amount of tokens lent.
     * @return The amount of `token` to be charged for the loan, on top of the returned principal.
     */
    function flashFee(
        address token,
        uint256 amount
    ) external view returns (uint256);
```

## [05] Overpaid asset is locked in lending pool when flashloan

*Note: At the judgeâ€™s request [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/7#issuecomment-1934027323), this downgraded issue from the same warden has been included in this report for completeness.*

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/core/InitCore.sol#L392

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/core/InitCore.sol#L380

Overpaid asset in locked when flashloan

### Proof of Concept

When flashloan, in this end to code check if the lending pool balance is greater than the consumed balance before flashloan:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/core/InitCore.sol#L392

```solidity
// execute callback
IFlashReceiver(msg.sender).flashCallback(_pools, _amts, _data);
// check pool balance after callback
for (uint i; i < _pools.length; i = i.uinc()) {
	_require(IERC20(tokens[i]).balanceOf(_pools[i]) >= balanceBefores[i], Errors.INVALID_AMOUNT_TO_REPAY);
}
```

The problem is that in case when user over-pay flashloan. 

Suppose user flash loan 10000 USDC and then repay 10100 USDC, the 100 USDC is lost and locked in the lending pool because the internal accounting of lending pool use cashAmount to track available balance.

However, the code above does not update [cash amount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/lending_pool/LendingPool.sol#L108) after flashloan is finished.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

while I understand this is an mitigation for finding

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-initcapital-findings/issues/3

the issue above can be resolved (issue 3)

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/core/InitCore.sol#L380

```solidity
// check that flash is enabled
_require(poolConfig.canFlash, Errors.FLASH_PAUSED);
```

When setModeStatus.canCollateralize and can.Borrow to false

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/core/Config.sol#L136

```solidity
 /// @inheritdoc IConfig
    function setModeStatus(uint16 _mode, ModeStatus calldata _status) external onlyGuardian {
        _require(_mode != 0, Errors.INVALID_MODE);
        __modeConfigs[_mode].status = _status;
        emit SetModeStatus(_mode, _status);
    }
```

Disable all flashloan for all the pool that belongs to a mode and sync the lending pool balance even user overpays flashloan

## [06] MarginTradeHook.sol#fillOrder does not validate order creator's minHealth when filling the order

*Note: At the judgeâ€™s request [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/7#issuecomment-1934027323), this downgraded issue from the same warden has been included in this report for completeness.*

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/hook/MarginTradingHook.sol#L179

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/hook/MarginTradingHook.sol#L484

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/hook/MarginTradingHook.sol#L208

MarginTradeHook.sol#fillOrder does not validate order creator's minHealth when filling the order

### Proof of Concept

In MarginTradingHook.sol, user can create stopLoss or take profits order, this is the logic for fulfilling order:

```solidity
IERC20(borrToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), repayAmt);
// transfer order owner's desired tokens to the specified recipient
IERC20(order.tokenOut).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, order.recipient, amtOut);
// repay tokens
_ensureApprove(borrToken, repayAmt);
IInitCore(CORE).repay(marginPos.borrPool, repayShares, order.initPosId);
// decollateralize coll pool tokens to executor
IInitCore(CORE).decollateralize(order.initPosId, marginPos.collPool, order.collAmt, msg.sender);

// update order status
__orders[_orderId].status = OrderStatus.Filled;
```

As we can see, first, the borr token is transfered in to prepare for repayment then the msg.sender pays order.recipient with token amount out:

```solidity
IERC20(order.tokenOut).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, order.recipient, amtOut);
```

Then, the we repay for order creator:

```solidity
_ensureApprove(borrToken, repayAmt);
IInitCore(CORE).repay(marginPos.borrPool, repayShares, order.initPosId);
```

Then the msg.sender that fulfill the order can remove order creator's collateral:

```solidity
IInitCore(CORE).decollateralize(order.initPosId, marginPos.collPool, order.collAmt, msg.sender);
```

The problem is that when removing order creator's collateral amount, unlike create Margin Position where the [code give user's option to validate the account min_health](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/hook/MarginTradingHook.sol#L179), the fillOrder logic cannot let order creator specify min_account_health after order fulfillment.

Let us consider the case below:

1. user create a margin position with 1 WEHT as collateral
2. user create a order and set order.coll amount to 0.5 WETH, this is ok for user, because even when the order is fulfilled, 0.5 WETH goes to order fulfiller, but there are 0.5 WETH collateral position left to ensure account health
3. user adjust margin position and remove 0.4 WETH collateral, but the order info remain unchanged, there is 0.6 WETH left as collateral
4. the user's order is fulfilled, but there is only 0.1 WETH left as collateral,
5. WETH price drops, user get liquidated because the fulfilled order remove the majority of collateral

This can be avoided if user can specify the account min health.

If user say, after order fulfilled, the account health cannot be below a certain threshold.

Fulfilling order that remove too much collateral can revert and user will not subject to liquidation.

The root cause is also [this order.collAmount can become stale](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/hook/MarginTradingHook.sol#L484).

After user [removeCollateral](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/hook/MarginTradingHook.sol#L208), the order.collAmount can become stale.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Allow the user to specify min account health when creating the order:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/a01c4de620be98f9e57a60cf6a82d4feaec54f58/contracts/hook/MarginTradingHook.sol#L346

```solidity
   function addStopLossOrder(
        uint _posId,
        uint _triggerPrice_e36,
        address _tokenOut,
        uint _limitPrice_e36,
        uint _collAmt,
		    uint min_account_health // here
    ) external returns (uint orderId) {
        orderId = _createOrder(_posId, _triggerPrice_e36, _tokenOut, _limitPrice_e36, _collAmt, min_account_health, OrderType.StopLoss);

# Gas Optimizations

For this audit, 2 reports were submitted by wardens detailing gas optimizations. The [report highlighted below](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/33) by **rvierdiiev** received the top score from the judge.

*The following wardens also submitted reports: [ladboy233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/8).*

## [G-01] Move some event from InitCore to PosManager.

To decrease bytecode size of `InitCore` contract you can move some events emitting to PosManager.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/main/contracts/core/InitCore.sol#L165
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/main/contracts/core/InitCore.sol#L217
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/main/contracts/core/InitCore.sol#L230
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/main/contracts/core/InitCore.sol#L245
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/main/contracts/core/InitCore.sol#L267
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/main/contracts/core/InitCore.sol#L285


```soldity
emit CreatePosition(msg.sender, posId, _mode, _viewer);

emit SetPositionMode(_posId, _mode);

emit Collateralize(_posId, _pool, amtColl);

emit Decollateralize(_posId, _pool, _to, amtDecoll);

emit CollateralizeWLp(_posId, _wLp, _tokenId, amtColl);

emit DecollateralizeWLp(_posId, _wLp, _tokenId, _to, amtDecoll);
```

## [G-02] Remove check inside `InitCore.callback` function.

The [check inside `InitCore.callback` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/main/contracts/core/InitCore.sol#L519) is not needed, because `InitCore` contract even don't have `coreCallback` function. You can decrease bytecode size by removing the check.

## [G-03] Move mode check to PosManager.

To decrease size of InitCore contract, you can [move 0 mode check](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/main/contracts/core/InitCore.sol#L163) to the PosManager.

## [G-04] Remove arrays check.

`InitCore._validateFlash` function [does arrays check](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational/blob/main/contracts/core/InitCore.sol#L573). This line can be removed and there will be no problems with that even if sizes will be different.

# Audit Analysis

For this audit, 2 analysis reports were submitted by wardens. An analysis report examines the codebase as a whole, providing observations and advice on such topics as architecture, mechanism, or approach. The [report highlighted below](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/9) by **ladboy233** received the top score from the judge.

*The following wardens also submitted reports: [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-init-capital-invitational-findings/issues/31).*

## For WLpMoeMasterChef.sol

### Overview
The `WLpMoeMasterChef.sol` contract is designed to allow users to wrap their Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens into wrapped LP (WLP) tokens. These WLP tokens can then be used as collateral for borrowing funds, integrating with a broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

### Concerns and Recommendations
1. **External MasterChef Integration:**
   - The contract relies on external MasterChef contracts for reward distributions. It's critical to ensure these external contracts are reliable and secure.
   - There should be mechanisms to handle scenarios where the MasterChef contract doesn't have sufficient rewards, to prevent disruptions in the WLP wrapping and unwrapping processes.

2. **Handling of External Calls:**
   - External calls, especially those related to reward distributions, should be designed to not block critical functionalities like LP wrapping or unwrapping. 
   - Implementing fail-safe mechanisms or timeouts for external calls could mitigate risks associated with these dependencies.

3. **Risk of Blocking Withdrawals/Liquidations:**
   - Any failure in the external calls or issues in the reward mechanism should not hinder users' ability to withdraw or liquidate their positions. This is crucial for maintaining trust and functionality in crisis scenarios.

## For MarginTradingBook.sol

### Overview
The `MarginTradingBook.sol` contract seems to handle margin trading functionalities, including the creation and management of orders such as stop-loss or take-profit.

### Concerns and Recommendations
1. **Race Conditions in Repay and Liquidation:**
   - The possibility of race conditions between repay actions and liquidations needs to be carefully managed. Synchronized checks or locking mechanisms might be necessary.

2. **Front-Running Risk in Order Creation and Filling:**
   - The system should be safeguarded against the possibility of order creators front-running order fills to manipulate outcomes. This could be addressed through mechanisms like time locks or penalties for abnormal behaviors.

3. **Uncertainty in Order Fulfillment:**
   - Orders may fail to be filled for various reasons, such as outdated collateral amounts, blocklisted recipients, or the liquidation of the user's collateral.
   - Implementing a function to preview if an order can be fulfilled would enhance transparency and usability. This function should account for all possible reasons an order might fail.

4. **Recommendation for Order Management:**
   - It's advisable to have a mechanism to cancel unfillable orders automatically or provide users with the ability to do so manually. This would prevent cluttering the system with stagnant orders and improve efficiency.

5. **Overall System Robustness:**
   - The interplay between different components (like MarginTradingBook, external contracts, and the broader ecosystem) needs to be tested thoroughly under various scenarios, especially edge cases, to ensure the resilience and reliability of the system.

### Time spent:
15 hours
